The following provides information on how to reproduce the results. 

CNNs: 

Note: All the files with double_lr in them used a learning rate of 0.02 (instead of 0.01). Will only use 0.01 in the future. Their naming convention is seed_double_lr_CNN_kernelheight_kernelwidth_kernel_depth_num_kernels_dataset_brute
(Old naming convention)

Above is deprecated. All .sh files give more info about how to run scripts and the reconstruct.py creates the file name based on the arguments. 

(Nikita TODO: once you have time run the old ones too and remove the result files with the old naming convention).
